# time-series-animator
A Python project that animates time-series data to visualize changes in variables like temperature, rainfall, or humidity over time. Provides step-by-step animation of data to identify trends and patterns easily.
**Project Overview:**
This project demonstrates the power of animated visualization for time-series data. By breaking the workflow into preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization, it ensures that the data is accurate and trends are displayed clearly. Users can observe how variables evolve over time and detect patterns that might be missed in static plots.

**Features:**

Preprocess raw CSV data for proper datetime formatting and ordering.

Clean and transform data by handling missing values and removing duplicates.

Animate multiple variables (temperature, rainfall, humidity) on a single graph.

Stepwise animation for clear trend visualization.

Option to export animations as GIF or MP4 for presentations.

**Technology Stack:**

Python 3.8+

Libraries: Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, FuncAnimation

Optional: Plotly/Bokeh for interactive visualization in future versions

****Future Enhancements:
Integrate real-time data streaming from APIs.

Add interactivity for zooming, hovering, and pausing animations.

Include predictive analytics to forecast future values.

Handle large-scale datasets with multiple variables efficiently.

Export interactive dashboards for professional or academic use.

**Use Cases:**

Climate monitoring and weather analysis

Stock market or financial trend visualization

Academic projects to illustrate time-series data

IoT sensor data visualization
